      <description>This paper develops a formula for the unemployment gap based on the Beveridge curve. In the US the gap is countercyclical. Published in JPubE Plus, 2021.</description>

      <title>Renormalization group study of systems with quadratic band touching</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/1/</link>

      <description>The perturbative effects of interactions in two two-dimensional systems with a single quadratic band touching point have been studied at a transition point. The effects of interactions have been studied using the renormalization group (RG) at one-loop level and it is found that at the transition a repulsive interaction is marginally relevant and an attractive interaction is marginally irrelevant. We corroborate the results obtained from the RG calculation by studying a microscopic model the ground state and Green&amp;rsquo;s functions of which can be obtained exactly. We find that away from the transition the system displays an instability towards forming an excitonic condensate.</description>

      <title>Persistence of False Paradigms in Low-Power Sciences</title>
