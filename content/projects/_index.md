### [[1] Quantum spin ice in three-dimensional Rydberg atom arrays](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.04657)

**Authors: Jeet Shah**, Gautam Nambiar, Alexey V. Gorshkov, and Victor Galitski

**Abstract:** Quantum spin liquids are exotic phases of matter whose low-energy physics is described as the deconfined phase of an emergent gauge theory. With recent theory proposals and an experiment showing preliminary signs of Z<sub>2</sub> topological order [G. Semeghini et al., Science 374, 1242 (2021)], Rydberg atom arrays have emerged as a promising platform to realize a quantum spin liquid. In this work, we propose a way to realize a U(1) quantum spin liquid in three spatial dimensions, described by the deconfined phase of U(1) gauge theory in a pyrochlore lattice Rydberg atom array. We study the ground state phase diagram of the proposed Rydberg system as a function of experimentally relevant parameters. Within our calculation, we find that by tuning the Rabi frequency, one can access both the confinement-deconfinement transition driven by a proliferation of "magnetic" monopoles and the Higgs transition driven by a proliferation of "electric" charges of the emergent gauge theory. We suggest experimental probes for distinguishing the deconfined phase from ordered phases. This work serves as a proposal to access a confinement-deconfinement transition in three spatial dimensions on a Rydberg-based quantum simulator.

### [[2] Renormalization group study of systems with quadratic band touching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.00249)

**Authors: Jeet Shah**, and Subroto Mukerjee

**Abstract:** Lifshitz transitions in two 2D systems with a single quadratic band touching point as the chemical potential is varied have been studied here. The effects of interactions have been studied using the renormalization group (RG) and it is found that at the transition a repulsive interaction is marginally relevant and an attractive interaction is marginally irrelevant. We corroborate the results obtained from the RG calculation by studying a microscopic model whose ground state and Green's functions can be obtained exactly. We find that away from the transition, the system displays an instability towards forming and excitonic condensate.

### [[3] Gauging the Kitaev chain](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.00607)

**Authors:** Umberto Borla, Ruben Verresen, **Jeet Shah**, and Sergej Moroz

**Abstract:** We gauge the fermion parity symmetry of the Kitaev chain. While the bulk of the model becomes an Ising chain of gauge-invariant spins in a tilted field, near the boundaries the global fermion parity symmetry survives gauging, leading to local gauge-invariant Majorana operators. In the absence of vortices, the Higgs phase exhibits fermionic symmetry-protected topological (SPT) order distinct from the Kitaev chain. Moreover, the deconfined phase can be stable even in the presence of vortices. We also undertake a comprehensive study of a gently gauged model which interpolates between the ordinary and gauged Kitaev chains. This showcases rich quantum criticality and illuminates the topological nature of the Higgs phase. Even in the absence of superconducting terms, gauging leads to an SPT phase which is intrinsically gapless due to an emergent anomaly.
